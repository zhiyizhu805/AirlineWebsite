## Introduction

This repository contains my first full-stack personal website which established in 2022, built at the beginning of my programming journey. As my maiden project, it was instrumental in laying the foundation for my subsequent group projects, where I was able to learn and improve further.

While this project is a significant milestone for me, it comes with its own set of limitations and shortcomings, which I recognize and embrace as part of the learning process. Some of the areas where it lacks include:

- **Poor CSS Design:** The styling and layout might not be visually appealing or follow best practices.
- **Lack of Proper Structure:** The code organization and separation of concerns are not well-defined.
- **Limited Code Reuse:** There was little focus on creating reusable components or functions, leading to some code duplication.

Despite these limitations, this project holds a special place in my heart ðŸ¤£ and serves as a reminder of where I started and how far I've comeðŸ¥¹. It's a living testament to my growth and continuous learning in the field of software development.

## Usage
